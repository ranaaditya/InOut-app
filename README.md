An app which can track your daily activites and provide real-time monitoring alongwith predicting your daily mood. People suffering from issues related to mental and emotional health have always been ostracised or shown mere sympathy. We tried to create an app which can keep a track over user's daily phone usage.

With this in mind, I have planned to build a real-time application which will:
1) monitor physical (voluntary as well as involuntary) symptoms associated with mental and emotional health
2) analyse social and digital activity of the user
3) provide counselling and create effective coping mechanism accordingly
4) Predict the daily mood of the user

The app will follow a decentralised structure, which will train itself according to the user. We have tried to built an app with the most comfortable UI for the user, which can help him/her to maintain a proper schedule to use their mobile phones.

The app currently uses the following submodules:

<br>
<a href="https://github.com/geforce6t/Mood-extraction"> Mood extractor Model </a>
